# Final-Project-Conquering-Responsive-Layout
My solution to the final project of Conquering Responsive Layouts by Kevin Powell.
# Approach
I employed Desktop first approach using flexbox to fit large screens and gradually broke it down for mobile devices and small screens
# Challenges
It was quite difficult to go outside the course of using mobile first approach. I guess I just wanted to try a different approach to solve the challenge.
